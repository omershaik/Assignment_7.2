    "\n",
    "By using a lot of data overfitting can be avoided, overfitting happens relatively as you have a small dataset, and you try to learn from it. But if you have a small database and you are forced to come with a model based on that. In such situation, you can use a technique known as cross validation. In this technique,  a model is usually given a dataset of a known data on which training (training data set) is run and a dataset of unknown data against which the model is tested."
